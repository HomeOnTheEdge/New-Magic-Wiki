# New-Magic-Wiki
A wiki to build a finalize my better tabletop storytelling system  
The over-arching goal is create a classless, (mostly) level-less, math-lite tabletop storytelling system that is noobie-friendly (easy to learn), but fun for advanced players (includes crunchy mechanics).  
A more immediate goal is to section-off the whole document and turn it into a wiki.
